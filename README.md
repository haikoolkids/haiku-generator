# Haiku Generator

Our app allows users to create haikus, either with their own lines, or with auto-generated lines at random. Users can select seasonal themes for display and vote on published haikus.

## How does it work?

-   First the users sign up or sign in.
-   Click on a haiku to view detail page and vote.
-   Navigate to create page to write or randomize your own haiku.
-   User is given an error message on submit if the poem contains an incorrect syllable count. Don't forget to select a theme!
